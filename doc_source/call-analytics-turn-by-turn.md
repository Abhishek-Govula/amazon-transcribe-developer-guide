# Turn\-by\-turn transcription<a name="call-analytics-turn-by-turn"></a>

Call analytics transcripts are displayed in a turn\-by\-turn format\. Each segment is followed by metrics for that segment, including detected issues, loudness scores, redaction, and sentiment\.

To increase accuracy and further customize your transcripts to your use case, such as including industry\-specific terms, use [Custom vocabularies](custom-vocabulary.md) or [Custom language models](custom-language-models.md) with your call analytics job\. To mask, remove, or tag words you don't want in your transcription results, such as profanity, add [Vocabulary filtering](vocabulary-filtering.md) to your call analytics job\.

To view an example of turn\-by\-turn output, see [Sample call analytics output](call-analytics-output.md)\.
