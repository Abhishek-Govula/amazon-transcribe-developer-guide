# Transcribing Streaming Audio<a name="how-streaming-transcription-med"></a>

Streaming transcription takes a stream of your audio data and transcribes it in real time\. It uses a bidirectional WebSocket connection so that the results of the transcription are returned to your application while you send more audio to Amazon Transcribe Medical\. You can also use it when you have an audio file that you want to process as it is transcribed\.

You can use streaming transcription in US English \(en\-US\)\.

For more information, see [Establish a Bi\-Directional Connection Using the WebSocket Protocol](websocket-med.md)\.
